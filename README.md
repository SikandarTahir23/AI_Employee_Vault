## 🏆 System Score: 10 / 10 — Production Ready

The AI Employee Vault is a personal AI operations platform that replaces manual business workflows with autonomous agents. It reads emails, generates LinkedIn content, sends WhatsApp messages, tracks accounting, and gives the CEO full control — all from a single dark-themed dashboard.

---

## ✨ Features

### 🖥️ CEO Command Dashboard (`app.py`)
- **Real-time financial metrics** — net profit, collected, expenses, bank balance (PKR)
- **Odoo accounting bridge** — live JSON + inline mock fallback (always shows data)
- **Kanban task board** — Needs Action / In Progress / Done
- **Agent console** — live tail of `logs/agent_activity.log`
- **Auto-refresh** every 30 seconds

### 📝 AI Post Creator
- Type a 1-line prompt → instant professional LinkedIn post
- Brand: **Multicraft Agency**
- Live preview & edit in dashboard (`st.text_area`)
